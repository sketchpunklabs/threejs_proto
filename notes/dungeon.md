  - Just a pile of random boxes. Rooms are the result of "twisted bisection" implemented on a discrete grid

  - IDEA
    - Maybe Try random boxes that has to intersect an existing edge
    - Can pick an edge and extrude a smaller version of it out

    - The idea is to make dungeons "locally symmetrical" to add a hint of "handcraftedness"
    - Most parts of a map are symmetrical but each has its own axis of symmetry. For example the area around the entrance at the top left corner (horizontal axis of symmetry) and the area right under it (vertical axis of symmetry). The whole map usually is not symmetrical.
